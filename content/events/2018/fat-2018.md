>Algorithmic systems are being adopted in a growing number of contexts. Fueled by big data, these systems filter, sort, score, recommend, personalize, and otherwise shape human experiences of socio-technical systems. Although these systems bring myriad benefits, they also contain inherent risks, such as codifying and entrenching biases; reducing accountability and hindering due process; and increasing the information assymmetry between data producers and data holders.
>
>FAT* is an annual conference dedicating to bringing together a diverse community to investigate and tackle issues in this emerging area.
