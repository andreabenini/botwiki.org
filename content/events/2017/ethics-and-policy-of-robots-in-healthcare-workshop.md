> The workshop aims to bring clarity to the debate on how to govern healthcare robots. The goal is to create a white paper on the governance of healthcare robots, a roadmap of guidelines for Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) in healthcare settings, and to include different robot types and contexts. Further, it will highlight the key questions/issues/challenges/concerns/gaps to be addressed by policymakers oin the near future. The central idea is to work towards meaningful frameworks that can be a) applied by roboticists and b) give full coverage to the protection of the user. The deliverable will be an open consultation document published on the websites of FRR and 4TU to raise awareness.
