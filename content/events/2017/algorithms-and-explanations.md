> Explanation has long been deemed a crucial aspect of accountability.  By requiring that powerful actors explain the bases of their decisions — the logic goes — we reduce the risks of error, abuse, and arbitrariness, thus producing more socially desirable decisions.  Decisionmaking processes employing machine learning algorithms and similar data-driven approaches complicate this equation.  Such approaches promise to refine and improve the accuracy and efficiency of decisionmaking processes, but the logic and rationale behind each decision remains opaque to human understanding.  The conference will grapple with the question of when and to what extent decisionmakers should be legally or ethically obligated to provide humanly meaningful explanations of individual decisions to those who are affected or to society at large.
