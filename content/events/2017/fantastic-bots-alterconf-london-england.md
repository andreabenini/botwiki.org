The [2017 AlterConf conference](https://www.alterconf.com/conferences/london-england) in London, England will feature a session hosted by [Aanand Prasad](https://twitter.com/aanand) titled [Fantastic Bots and Where To Find Them](https://www.alterconf.com/talks/fantastic-bots-and-where-find-them):

> Twitter bots, outside of the realm of branded auto-follow hashtag spam boredom, are a fascinating world of pointless art-generating machines, whether theyâ€™re writing poetry/fiction/news, impersonating people/animals/inanimate objects, automating popular memes to death, glitching and corrupting images in a hundred different ways, wasting the time of reactionary basement-dwellers or telling a single, monotone joke for all eternity. I want to give you a tour through some of the most interesting and important ones, delve into the issues of etiquette, ethics and politics that the art of botmaking has surfaced, and show you how easy it is to make your own.
