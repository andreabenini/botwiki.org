> Computational creativity intersects social justice in three major ways. First, artificial intelligence systems (many of them arguably computationally creative) play a role in all aspects of our lives: from curating and assessing the media we consume to policing our communities to enabling or rejecting our participation in economic society. Second, computational creativity models, generates and evaluates new forms of art, and art has a long history of cultural commentary and critique, both reflecting and influencing societal values. Third, our community reflects the institutionalized biases that are built into its constituent disciplines and backgrounds, such as discipline-specific rejection of creative work by people with marginalized identities, or reduced prevalence of many groups in computer science and technology.
