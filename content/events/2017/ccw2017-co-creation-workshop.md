> Co-creation is a new interdisciplinary research topic that asks questions related to human-computer interaction, computational creativity, and cognitive science. It investigates how two or more agents interact to produce emergent meaning and artifacts in a participatory process of meaning building (i.e. participatory sense-making). We invite researchers and creative practitioners involved in research projects related to co-creation to participate. The workshop is designed to discuss and share technical, theoretical, and empirical findings related to the unique challenges of co-creation as an application domain.
