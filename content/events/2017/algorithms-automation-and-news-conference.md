> Algorithms and automation increasingly are connected to many aspects of news production, distribution, and consumption. We invite original, unpublished papers to address such issues at an international conference to be held at the Center for Advanced Studies, LMU Munich, May 22-23, 2018 — shortly before the ICA annual convention in Prague, not far from Munich. Thanks to the generous support of our sponsors, there will be no conference fee, and free hotel accommodation will be provided for presenters, in addition to opportunities for need-based travel stipends. Select papers from the conference will be published in a special issue of Digital Journalism as well as a proposed edited volume. On this site, you will find the complete CfP, the timeline of events, and details regarding speakers and organizers.s
