Using [Mozilla's Open Badges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Open_Badges) and [Badgr](http://info.badgr.io/), we are issuing Botmaker Badges to people who create bots and resources for botmakers! See the list and conditions for applying below.

Once you get your badge, you can add it to your [Mozilla Backpack](https://backpack.openbadges.org/) and show it off [like this](https://backpack.openbadges.org/share/110353f11a04184be77cd6ae7e856fea/)!

To apply, add your bot to Botwiki using our [submit form](http://botwiki.org/submit-your-bot), and in the description, mention that you're applying for this badge.

You can either include your email in the description, so we can send you your badge (the email will **not**, of course, be published), or you can send a separate email to [stefan@botwiki.org](mailto:stefan@botwiki.org) (or a [DM on Twitter](https://twitter.com/fourtonfish)) with your email address and a link to your bot.

### Bot Teacher [¶](#bot-teacher-badge){.pilcrow} {#bot-teacher-badge}

![Bot Teacher Badge](/content/botmaker-badges/images/badge-teacher.png){.float-right .extra-margin}

To apply for this badge, send an email to [stefan@botwiki.org](mailto:stefan@botwiki.org) (or a [DM on Twitter](https://twitter.com/fourtonfish)) with your email address and a link to at least one tutorial that teaches how to make a bot.

Please also provide a short description that includes information on the targeted audience (beginner, advanced) and language(s) and technologies used.

It is not necessary for the tutorial to be re-hosted on Botwiki, but if you'd like, this can be done :-)
