The theme for the May 2016 challenge, sponsored by [NYPL Labs](https://twitter.com/nypl_labs), was ***PUBLIC DOMAIN***!

[NYPL](https://twitter.com/nypl)'s recent [public domain release](http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/) makes for a perfect source material for this challenge :-)


> [NYPL Digital Collections](http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/) contains hi-res images, metadata, and tools facilitating digital creation and reuse.
>
> The release represents both a simplification and an enhancement of digital access to a trove of unique and rare materials: a removal of administration fees and processes from public domain content, and also improvements to interfaces ‚Äî popular and technical ‚Äî to the digital assets themselves.
>
> Online users of the [NYPL Digital Collections](http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/) website now find more prominent download links and filters highlighting restriction-free content; while more technically inclined users benefit from updates to the [Library's collections API](http://api.repo.nypl.org/) enabling bulk use and analysis, as well as data exports and utilities posted to [NYPL's GitHub account](http://github.com/nypl-publicdomain/). These changes are intended to facilitate sharing, research and reuse by scholars, artists, educators, technologists, publishers, and Internet users of all kinds.
