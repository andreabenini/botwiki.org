One of the key ideas behind **Botwiki** is preserving the work of creative people -- and **Botwiki** and all the related projects are [open source](https://github.com/botwiki/) for the same reason. With [Botmakers.org](https://botmakers.org/), I am trying to create [a friendly and inviting community](https://github.com/botwiki/botmakers.org/blob/master/Code%20of%20Conduct.md) where anyone can join and share their interest in bots.

The group already consists of **over 500 members**: experienced and beginner programmers, journalists, people running their own bot-centered companies, artists.

There's a lot that goes into maintaining **Botwiki** and all the related side projects:

- updating **Botwiki** with new bots, tutorials and other resources
- managing the [Botmakers.org](https://botmakers.org/) community
- staying on top of the latest news and compiling them for the [Bot! zine](https://botmakers.org/) newsletter
- doing [occasional interviews](https://botwiki.org/tag/interview/) with members of the "botmaking scene"
- organizing and promoting the [Monthly Bot Challenge](https://botwiki.org/monthly-bot-challenge/), which also includes reaching out to potential sponsors
- and overall just keeping all the sites running

And you are more than welcome to join [Botmakers.org](https://botmakers.org/), regardless of your programming experience! The one thing we all have in common is that we just really like bots :-)
