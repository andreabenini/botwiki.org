Hi!

My name is Stefan [*stefn*] and I'm [@stefan](https://botmakers.slack.com/messages/@stefan/details/) on [Botmakers](https://botmakers.org/) and [@fourtonfish](https://twitter.com/fourtonfish) on Twitter. I am the original creator of Botwiki, a [Botmakers](https://botmakers.org/) admin, and I also wrote the first 32 issues of [Bot! zine](https://botzine.org/).

I'm Veronica!

I'm a podcaster, writer, and bot/AI enthusiast from San Francisco. I love talking and learning about bot projects out there in the world, so tweet them to me [@veronica](https://twitter.com/veronica)!

I'm also an admin at [botmakers.org](https://botmakers.org/), maintain the [Bot! zine](https://botzine.org/) newsletter, and sometimes I help [@botwikidotorg](https://twitter.com/botwikidotorg) figure out what to tweet.
