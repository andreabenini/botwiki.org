Botwiki was created in July 2015 by [Stefan Bohacek](/about/team#stefan) with the goal of preserving interesting and creative examples of online bots, and providing tutorials and other resources to folks interested in making fun, whimsical, or useful bots. 

Later in August, the [Botmakers](https://botmakers.org/) online group was set up as a [safe](https://github.com/botwiki/botmakers.org/blob/master/Code%20of%20Conduct.md) and friendly online space for artists, tinkerers, bot enthusiasts and seasoned developers to share ideas, resources, and their bot creations, regardless of their technical knowledge.

In March 2016, [Veronica Belmont](/about/team#veronica) joined Stefan as a Botmakers administrator and took over the [Bot! zine](https://botzine.org/) newsletter Stefan has started as a way to keep the community of bot enthusiasts updated on the latest news.
