***THIS DOCUMENT IS A DRAFT***

This document is an addition to the existing [Code of Conduct](/coc/) which already applies equally to all members, moderators, and the bots in the [Botmakers](https://botmakers.org) Slack group. We are making our guidelines public to keep things in our group transparent, to show our commitment to our members, and to encourage an open dialogue and constructive feedback.

## Guidelines [Â¶](#notes){.pilcrow} {#guidelines}

- The Botwiki/Botmakers [Code Of Conduct](/coc/) applies to everyone, including bots and moderators
- **@everyone**/**@channel**/**@here** should be only used for critical announcements
- Members of Botmakers should be encouraged to share their thoughts on feedback either through **@botwikibot** or [one of our surveys](/about/surveys) which allow anonymous feedback
- When inviting people to Botmakers, always share the URL as [botmakers.org](https://botmakers.org/). There is no way to sign up on [bookmakers.slack.com](https://bookmakers.slack.com), only to sign in if you're already a member.
