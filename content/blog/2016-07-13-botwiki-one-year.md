I registered the [botwiki.org](https://botwiki.org/) domain on July 12, 2015, which means **Botwiki is one year old** now! 🎂👏👏👏🎉

I already [shared](/content/events/botwiki-edit-a-thon-march-21-2016/botwiki-presentation.pdf) some of the achievements at the [Botwiki Edit-a-Thon](/events/botwiki-edit-a-thon-march-21-2016/) back in March, and the project continued to grow since then. Botwiki gets thousands of visits every month, the [@botwikidotorg](https://twitter.com/botwikidotorg) Twitter account has well over 800 followers, and the number of [Bot! zine](https://botzine.org/) subscribers is nearing 500. 

There have been a few setbacks as well, mainly due to lack of time in the past 2-3 months. The [Monthly Bot Challenge](/monthly-bot-challenge/) is currently on hold, and after a brief hiatus, [Veronica Belmont](https://twitter.com/veronica) took over the [Bot! zine](https://botzine.org/) newsletter. And the [Botmakers](https://botmakers.org/) community became a bit quiet lately.

Nonetheless, Botwiki and all the related projects have been very successful. Even with the recent hype around bots, there is still not a site similar to Botwiki: a place to explore creative work of enthusiasts and hobby and professional programmers. A source of tutorials, essays, articles, and other resources dedicated to botmaking.

I would like to thank everyone who supported Botwiki either through [donations](/about/support/), [volunteer work](https://github.com/botwiki/botwiki.org/graphs/contributors), or just spreading the word about the site. 

Thanks everyone, and here's to another year of botmaking and bot appreciation! 🤖
