**Sidekick** can monitor Twitter for specific keywords and hashtags. It will then post relevant tweets to a designated Slack channel and if you want, you can easily ask Sidekick to retweet a particular tweet using the ‚≠ê, ‚ù§, or üëç reactions.

You can easily filter out the tweets based on the account or the content of the tweets.



![Share to retweet](/content/projects/sidekick/images/share-to-retweet.png) {.centered .screenshot}

Sidekick can also retweet tweets that are shared with the bot via a DM. 


![Poll](/content/projects/sidekick/images/poll.png) {.centered .screenshot}

Sidekick knows how to do many other neat and useful things, like set up polls, move messages to different channels, and more.
