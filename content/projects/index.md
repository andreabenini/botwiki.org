Detective is an online game where players are assigned roles of a Detective or an Impostor. A third role, Robot, is handled by a chat bot (powered by [BOT libre!](https://www.botlibre.com/)).

The Detective has to correctly identify the Impostor, whose goal is to convince the Detective they are speaking to the Robot.
