Botwiki's Bot Workshops are envisioned as a series of events (mostly online, possibly also offline) for botmakers of all levels of technical expertise: artists, tinkerers, enthusiasts, seasoned pros.

Watch our first workshop [below](#botmaking-from-the-ground-up), and follow [@botwikidotorg](https://twitter.com/botwikidotorg) for updates on future events!

[Botmaking from the Ground Up](/bot-workshops/botmaking-from-the-ground-up) is a fun and informative [workshop](/bot-workshops/) on how to get started writing Twitter bots.

With [Bradley Momberger](https://twitter.com/air_hadoken)'s guidance, you will create three bots with the barest minimum of programming required.
