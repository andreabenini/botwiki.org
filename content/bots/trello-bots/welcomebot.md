[welcomebot](https://trello.com/welcomebot) is an [open source](https://github.com/websitesfortrello/welcomebot) Trello bot created by [@fiatjaf](https://twitter.com/fiatjaf). 

If you have a board where you want to let anyone enter, to comment and see and all that, just create a card, name it in any way you want (it can be something like "Welcome to this board, please comment here to enter!") and add [welcomebot](https://trello.com/welcomebot) to that card.

Every Trello user who leaves a comment in that card will be automatically added to the board.
