[refbot](https://trello.com/refbot) is an [open source](https://github.com/websitesfortrello/refbot) Trello bot created by [@fiatjaf](https://twitter.com/fiatjaf). 

Whenever someone posts a link from a card to other card, [refbot](https://trello.com/refbot) goes to the referenced card and adds a backreference to the first.

Much like [GitHub](https://github.com/) backreferences on issues.
