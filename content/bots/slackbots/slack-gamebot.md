[slack-gamebot](https://github.com/dblock/slack-gamebot) is an [open source](https://github.com/dblock/slack-gamebot) Slack bot created by [Daniel Doubrovkine](https://twitter.com/dblockdotorg). 

It's a generic game bot for slack that plays ping-pong (with two, four, or more players), chess, and more. It was inspired by [slack-pongbot](https://github.com/andrewvy/slack-pongbot), but should be more robust and easier to build upon.
