[@start_this_up](https://twitter.com/start_this_up) is a Twitter bot created by [Harry Caufield](https://twitter.com/harry_caufield) that invents names and logos for nonexistent startups.

> Moves slow, breaks stuff anyway. Partially crafted by neural network - names are generated using an LSTM trained on startup company names. Everything else is randomly generated.
