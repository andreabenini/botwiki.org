[@birdcallbot](https://twitter.com/birdcallbot) is an [open source](https://github.com/codmart/birdcallbot) Twitter bot created by [Cody Martinez](https://twitter.com/codmart) that posts short videos of bird calls/songs a few times a day by scraping the [Macaulay Library database](https://www.macaulaylibrary.org/) to find audio recordings of birds which it then finds a name for and uses to locate photos of those birds bird.

The multimedia content is combined into an mp4 and truncated to 30 seconds and posted with credit attributions to the recordists and photographers who are responsible for the sourced content. A code based explanation can be found [on GitHub](github.com/codmart/birdcallbot/blob/master/docs/psuedo-code.txt).
