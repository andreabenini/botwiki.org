[@personaIitea](https://twitter.com/personaIitea) is an [open source](http://www.cheapbotsdonequick.com/source/personaIitea) Twitter bot created by [Kate Gray](https://twitter.com/hownottodraw). 

This bot generates a new type of tea every six hours. Teas have a little generative biography as well as a picture of a representative teabag. The teabags have faces. All of this is driven by a Tracery grammar.

Co-contributors to this bot were Mario Zama (https://twitter.com/afk_mcz, code) and Typhaine Uro (https://twitter.com/__Tyu, art).
