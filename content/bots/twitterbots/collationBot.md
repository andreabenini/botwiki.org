[@collationBot](https://twitter.com/collationBot) is a Twitter bot created by [Dot Porter](https://twitter.com/leoba) that tweets collation formulas that are pulled from medieval manuscript descriptions hosted on [OPenn](http://openn.library.upenn.edu/), and from the [British Library's Hebrew Manuscripts](https://data.bl.uk/hebrewmanuscripts/).

> A collation formula describes how a manuscript is constructed in terms of quires (that is, leaves gathered together) and leaves (single pieces of parchment or paper), and is usually in the format e.g., 1(8), 2-4(10) (that is, quire 1 has 8 leaves, quires 2-4 have 10 leaves each), although as the bot illustrates in actuality the formulas are many and varied!
