[@eleanorrigbot](https://twitter.com/eleanorrigbot) is an [open source](https://github.com/textbook/eleanor-rigbot) Twitter bot created by [Jonathan Sharpe](https://twitter.com/jonrsharpe) that monitors the Twitter stream (currently just from Liverpool) looking for tweets that could be sung as a verse to [Eleanor Rigby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_Rigby), a song by [the Beatles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles). If it finds any, it retweets them.
