[@FortheRecordBot](https://twitter.com/FortheRecordBot) is an [open source](https://github.com/ForTheRecordBot/ForTheRecordBot) Twitter bot created by [Quinn Heraty](https://twitter.com/quinnheraty). 

Author notes:

> When I hear "For the record" colloquially, I am hearing an individual say, "I have something to say, and you will take note of what I am saying." Sometimes it's jokey, sometimes it's angry, sometimes it's picayune, sometimes it's interpersonal inventory-taking, but it always (to me) sounds like, "I want to be heard."
> 
With [@FortheRecordBot](https://twitter.com/FortheRecordBot), when someone's tweet uses the phrase "For the record," the [@FortheRecordBot](https://twitter.com/FortheRecordBot) (aka FTRbot) retweets that tweet,and adds "It's been noted #fortherecord." 
>
>For example, I tweeted this at 1:34am on the day the bot was made:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">for the record, we made the bot <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ORDcamp?src=hash">#ORDcamp</a> --&gt; <a href="https://twitter.com/ForTheRecordBot">@ForTheRecordBot</a></p>&mdash; quinn (@quinnheraty) <a href="https://twitter.com/quinnheraty/status/691147012033507328">January 24, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

>Then, [@FortheRecordBot](https://twitter.com/FortheRecordBot) picked it up and retweeted it:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It&#39;s been noted <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/fortherecord?src=hash">#fortherecord</a> <a href="https://t.co/idQhUgCdbR">https://t.co/idQhUgCdbR</a></p>&mdash; For The Record Bot (@ForTheRecordBot) <a href="https://twitter.com/ForTheRecordBot/status/691147141142728704">January 24, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

>As you can see, some people might change their mind about being "on the record":

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It&#39;s been noted <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/fortherecord?src=hash">#fortherecord</a> <a href="https://t.co/9Ufcvmkq1p">https://t.co/9Ufcvmkq1p</a></p>&mdash; For The Record Bot (@ForTheRecordBot) <a href="https://twitter.com/ForTheRecordBot/status/691229755711037440">January 24, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

>So this bot can not only act as an unofficial "record" but, unintentionally
>on my part, is also a reminder that Twitter is public and a kind of
>"record."
>
>People are sometimes delighted when the bot picks up their tweet:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Giggling like crazy. <a href="https://t.co/FIRGAdhnJL">https://t.co/FIRGAdhnJL</a></p>&mdash; Brendon (@ptenbob) <a href="https://twitter.com/ptenbob/status/692712003245346817">January 28, 2016</a></blockquote>
