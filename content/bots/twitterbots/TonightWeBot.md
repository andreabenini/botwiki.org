[@TonightWeBot](https://twitter.com/TonightWeBot) is a Twitter bot created by [@TRASEVOL_DOG](https://twitter.com/TRASEVOL_DOG) inspired by [Richard Hawley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hawley)'s "Tonight The Streets Are Ours" song -- it tweets procedurally generated variants of that very phrase.
