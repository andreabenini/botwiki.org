[@EmergencyPipou](https://twitter.com/EmergencyPipou) is an [open source](https://github.com/WhiteFangs/EmergencyPipou) Twitter bot created by [@White_Fangs](https://twitter.com/White_Fangs) that randomly tweets hugs and kisses in French to its followers, it follows back and replies to mentions.

The concept was created by [@petosorus](https://twitter.com/petosorus) using [Python](https://github.com/petosorus/emergencyPipou), but after the bot stopped working, it was rewritten in [PHP](https://github.com/WhiteFangs/EmergencyPipou) and improved by [@White_Fangs](https://twitter.com/White_Fangs), with the original author's permission.
