[revisit.link](http://revisit.link/) (website no longer available) was originally an [opensource](https://github.com/revisitors/revisit.link) "API experiment" created by Jen Fong-Adwent aka [Edna Piranha](https://twitter.com/ednapiranha). It consisted of a page that allowed the user to upload an image and apply a variety effects to it. The code to apply the effects was hosted by other people participating in this "experiment" and was similarly open-sourced ([one example](https://github.com/fourtonfish/transposer1000) by [@fourtonfish](https://twitter.com/ednapiranha)).

[@plzrevisit](https://twitter.com/plzrevisit) served as a Twitter-based interface to revisit.link. The bot was created by [@beaugunderson](https://twitter.com/beaugunderson).
