[@ceasedesistbot](https://twitter.com/ceasedesistbot) is an [open source](https://github.com/tpinecone/tweetbots) Twitter bot created by [Terian Koscik](https://twitter.com/spine_cone). It periodically looks at tweets from its followers, and responds to them claiming that content in their tweets is in violation of copyright laws. Unfortunately sometimes taken seriously.
