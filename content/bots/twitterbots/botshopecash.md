[@botshopecash](https://twitter.com/botshopecash) is a Twitter bot created by [@curious_jp](https://twitter.com/curious_jp) that digests [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/) obituary information and a part-of-speech dictionary to write snowclone jokes of the form of *"<n> years ago we had **X**, **Y**, and **Z**. Now we have no **x**, no **y**, and no **z**"*.


From [iloveepoetry.com](http://iloveepoetry.com/?p=11194):

> A snowclone is a particular kind of cliche, popularly originated by Geoff Pullum. The name comes from Dr. Pullum’s much-maligned “If Eskimos have N words for snow, X surely have Y words for Z”. An easier example might be “X is the new Y.” The short definition of this neologism might be n. fill-in-the-blank headline.
