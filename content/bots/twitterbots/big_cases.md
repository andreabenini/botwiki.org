[@big_cases](https://twitter.com/big_cases) is an [open source](https://github.com/bdheath/Big-Cases) Twitter bot created by [Brad Heath](https://twitter.com/bradheath) from [USA Today](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today) that tweets new filings from major cases in U.S. district courts, updated every 4 minutes.

From associated GitHub repo:

> The bot uses PACER RSS feeds to gather the latest filings from 74 U.S. District Courts and five federal courts of appeals and stores the docket entries in a database. It matches new filings against a preselected list of major cases, scrapes matching documents from PACER, uploads them to a DocumentCloud project and posts the results on Twitter.
