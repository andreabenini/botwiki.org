[@mesmerinion](https://twitter.com/mesmerinion) is a Twitter bot created by [Mike Judge](https://twitter.com/mikelovesrobots) that posts generative creepy text accompanied by a black and white "[mandala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandala)" displaying circular banding and radial symmetry. Visual appearance is often reminiscent of iron filings dancing upon a piece of white paper.
