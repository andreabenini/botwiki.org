[@infinite_scream](https://twitter.com/infinite_scream) is a Twitter bot created by [Nora Reed](https://twitter.com/NoraReed) that generates and infinite stream of screams.

> On any given day, @infinite_scream’s Twitter timeline is a chorus of all-caps yelling. “AAAAHHHHHHH,” it screamed shortly after its creation in October 2015; “AAAAAAAAAH,” it expelled today, during the morning commute. Years separate those tweets, but the only changes to the monosyllabic account across 19 months are its variations in spelling. The intention is consistent.
