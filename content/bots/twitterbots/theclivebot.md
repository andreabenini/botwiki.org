[@theclivebot](https://twitter.com/theclivebot) is a Twitter bot created by [Clive Thompson](https://twitter.com/pomeranian99). 

> It generates a short poem, four times a day, using a large corpus of poetic lines gently translated from poets of antiquity -- Basho, Sappho -- as well as a bunch I've written myself, inspired by them.
