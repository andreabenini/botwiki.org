[@PepitoTheCat](https://twitter.com/PepitoTheCat) is a Twitter bot created by [Clément Storck](https://twitter.com/clementstorck). 

The bot posts the comings and goings of a black cat that lives in France, showing a snapshot, time, and some state information, triggered by a home automation device linked to the cat door and connected with the PushingBox notification framework.  The bot is also present on Facebook and posts short video clips to Vine.
