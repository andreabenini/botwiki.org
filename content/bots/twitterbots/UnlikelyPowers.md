[@UnlikelyPowers](https://twitter.com/UnlikelyPowers) is an [open source](http://cheapbotsdonequick.com/source/unlikelypowers) Twitter bot created by [Joey Jones](https://twitter.com/friedegger). 

The bot generates unlikely superpowers with drawbacks every 3 hours. It was inspired by the odd mishmash powers of the [Worm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worm_(web_serial)) web serial and the absurd specificity of abilities in [Superhero League of Hoboken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero_League_of_Hoboken).
