[@thatsnotmybot](https://twitter.com/thatsnotmybot) is an [open source](https://github.com/wjt/fewerror/blob/master/fewerror/thatsnotmybot.py) Twitter bot created by [Will Thompson](https://twitter.com/wjjjjt). 

> That’s Not My Bot… is inspired by the series of books for young children by Fiona Watt and Rachel Wells. The books have 8 spreads, in this format (from “That’s Not My Tractor…”):
>
>    That’s not my tractor. Its engine is too bumpy.
>
>    That’s not my tractor. Its trailer is too rough.
>
>    [more pages]
>
>    That’s my tractor! Its headlamps are so shiny.
>
> Each page has a cartoon of a different tractor, with a textured area representing the adjective: corrugated foil for “bumpy”, rough foil for “rough”, velcro for “scratchy”, and so on.
>
> The bot has a simple grammar for generating sentences like this, and fixes the first object (eg “tractor”) for 1 or more negatives before generating a positive sentence, and gradually posts them as threaded tweets.
