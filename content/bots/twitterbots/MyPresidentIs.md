[@MyPresidentIs](https://twitter.com/MyPresidentIs) is an [open source](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/project/my-president-bot) Twitter bot created by [Omayeli Arenyeka](https://twitter.com/YellzHeard). 

> It tweets who / what *my* president is (i.e anyone and anything that's not either of the presidents of the countries I've lived in most of my life - Donald Trump and Muhammad Buhari).
>
> It was inspired by a [tweet by Quinta Brunson](https://twitter.com/quintabrunson/status/932308107706937345) and is [hosted on Glitch](https://my-president-bot.glitch.me)
