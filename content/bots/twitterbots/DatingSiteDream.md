[@DatingSiteDream](https://twitter.com/DatingSiteDream) is an [open source](https://github.com/Hoeyboey/Dating-Site-Message-Procedural-Generation) Twitter bot created by [@Hoeyboey](https://twitter.com/hoeyboey). 

This bot procedurally generates dating site messages based on a corpus of messages received on dating sites. The underlying generation appears to be a modified markov method. Source is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/Hoeyboey/Dating-Site-Message-Procedural-Generation), but not the underlying corpus.
