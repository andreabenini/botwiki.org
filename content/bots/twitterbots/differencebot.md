[@differencebot](https://twitter.com/differencebot) is an [open source](https://github.com/hatkirby/difference) Twitter bot created by [hatkirby](https://twitter.com/starla4444). 

> The Binary Generator posts two pictures of the same sort of thing, and then invents a binary that supposedly dichotomizes the pictured things. It's a parody of the sort of black-and-white thinking that goes into a lot of societal constructs such as the gender binary.
