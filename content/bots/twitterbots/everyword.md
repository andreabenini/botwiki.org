[@everyword](https://twitter.com/everyword), an [open source](https://github.com/aparrish/everywordbot) Twitter bot created by [Allison Parrish](https://twitter.com/aparrish), began its mission to tweet every word in the English language in 2007 and completed it in 2014.

It is one of the most well-known Twitter bots with over 78,000 followers (as of September 2015) and is an [inspiration](https://twitter.com/everyword/following) to several other bots that tweet in the so-called "everyword style".

You can read more about the bot on [Allison's website](http://www.decontextualize.com/2014/06/task-complete/), and see the bot's most popular tweets on [favstar.fm](http://favstar.fm/users/everyword).
