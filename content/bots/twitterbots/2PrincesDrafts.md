[@2PrincesDrafts](https://twitter.com/2PrincesDrafts) is an [open source](https://github.com/amarriner/TwoPrinces) Twitter bot created by [amarriner](https://twitter.com/amarriner). 

Simple bot that tweets "drafts" of the first few lines of Two Princes by the Spin Doctors. Basically replaces some words (princes with other random royalty, for example) and random scat!
