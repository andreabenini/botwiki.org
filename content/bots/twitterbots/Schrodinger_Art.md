[@Schrodinger_Art](https://twitter.com/Schrodinger_Art) is an [open source](https://github.com/KeirMeDear/Schrodinger_Art/tree/master) randomised generative text bot on Twitter created by [@KeirMeDear](https://twitter.com/keirmedear) that tweets titles of artworks. These artworks are suspended between being an idea and never being made much like how [Schrodingerâ€™s cat](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat) was suspended between being alive and being dead.
